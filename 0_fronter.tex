\begin{abstracts}
	
	In recent decades, the volume of information increases dramatically, leading to
	an urgent demand for high-performance data processing technologies. XML document
	processing as a common and popularly used information processing technique has
	been intensively studied.
	
	About 20 years ago at the very early stage of XML processing, studies mainly
	focused on the sequential ways,  which were limited by the fact that CPUs at
	the time were commonly single-core processors. In the recent decade, with the
	development of multiple-core CPUs, it provides not only more cores we can use
	in a sinlge CPU, but also better availability with cheaper prices.  Therefore,
	parallization become popular in information processing.
	
	Parallelization of XPath queries over XML documents became popular started from
	the recnet decade. At the time, studies focused on a small set of XPath queires
	and were designed to process XML documents in a shared-memory environment.
	Therefore, they are not practical for processing large XML documents, making
	them difficult to meet the requirements of processing rapidly grown large XML
	documents.
	
	To overcome the difficulties, we first revived an existing study proposed by
	Bordawekar et al. in 2008. Their work was implemented on an XSLT processor Xalan
	and has already been out of date now due to the developments of hardware and
	software. We presented our three implementations on top of a state-of-the-art
	XML databases engine BaseX over XML documents sized server gigabytes. Since
	BaseX provides full support for XQuery/XQuery 3.1, we can harness this feature
	to process subqueries from the division of target XPath queries.
	
	This pre-hand study establishes the availability of Bordawekar et al's work.
	Then, we propose a fragmentation approach that can divide an XML document into
	size-balanced subtrees with randomization for achieving better load-balance.
	Along with the previous data partitioning strategy, we can process large XML
	documents efficiently in distribute-memory environments.
	
	The previous partition and fragmentation based study enables us to easily
	process  large XML documents in distribute-memory environments. However, it
	still has its  flasw that it is limited to top-down queries. Therefore, to
	enrich the expressness  of our study, we then proposed a novel tree, called
	partial tree. With partial tree, we can make the XML processing support more
	types of queries, making it more feasuable to utilize computer clusters. We also
	propose an efficient BFS-array based implementation of partial tree.
	
	There are two important contributions proposed in the thesis.
	
	The first contribution involves three implementations of Bordawekar et al's
	partitioning strategies, and our observations and perspectives from the
	experiment results. Our implementations are designed for the parallelization of
	XPath queries on top of BaseX. With these implementations, XPath queries can be
	easily parallelized by simply rewriting XPath queries with XQuery expressions.
	We conduct experiments to evaluate our implementations and the results showed
	that these implementations achieved significant speedups over two large XML
	documents. Besides the experiment results, we also present significant
	observations and perspectives from the experiment results. Then, based on them,
	we extend the fragmentation algorithms to exploit data partitioning strategy in
	distributed-memory environments.
	
	The second contribution is the design of a novel tree structure, called partial
	tree, for parallel XML processing. With this tree structure, we can split an XML
	document into multiple chunks and represent each of the chunks with partial
	trees. We also design a series of algorithms for evaluating queries over these
	partial trees. Since the partial trees are created from separated chunks, we can
	distribute these chunks to computer clusters. In this way, we can run queries on
	them in distributed memory environments. Then, we propose an efficient
	implementation of partial tree. Based on indexing techniques, we developed an
	indexing scheme, called BFS-array index along with grouped index. With this
	indexing scheme, we can implement partial tree efficiently, in both memory
	consumption and absolute query performance. The experiments showed that the
	implementation can process 100s GB of XML documents with 32 EC2 computers. The
	execution times were only seconds for most queries used in the experiments and
	the throughput was approximately 1 GB/s.
