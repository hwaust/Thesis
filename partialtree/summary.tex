\section{Summary}

In this chapter, we have first developed a novel tree structure called partial
tree based on a vertical fragmentation of XML documents. To construct partial
trees from an XML document, there are four phases. First, we split the XML
document into several chunks. Second, we parse the chunks in parallel to form
several sets of subtrees that have some open nodes. Third, we compute pre-paths
from all open nodes. Last, we put pre-paths to each corresponding set of
subtrees to complete the partial tree construction.

After the introduction to partial tree, we have also designed query algorithms
for most useful class of XPath queries with three examples to demonstrate how
the query algorithms work.

Last, we have implemented partial tree with a BFS-array based index for high-
efficiency. The experiment shows that the implementation reaches a good absolute
query time that can evaluate XPath queries over 100s GB of XML documents in 100s
millisecond to several seconds.
